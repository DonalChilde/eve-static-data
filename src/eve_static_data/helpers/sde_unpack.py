# Refactor note: avoid using ZipFile.extractall() directly on unvalidated archive members.
# Why this should change:
# - extractall() trusts member paths from the archive.
# - Unsafe members can use absolute paths or ".." segments to escape the target directory.
# - This is the classic zip-slip risk.
# - The current implementation also only moves top-level files after extraction, so nested archive content would be silently ignored.
# Safer approach:
# 1. Inspect each ZipInfo/member before extraction.
# 2. Reject unsafe names:
# - absolute paths
# - paths that resolve outside the temp extraction directory
# - optionally symlinks or other unsupported member types
# 3. Extract members one at a time only after validating the destination path.
# 4. Decide whether nested directories are supported:
# - if yes, preserve directory structure when moving into the final output dir
# - if no, fail fast when a member is not a top-level regular file
# 5. Only publish/move the unpacked result after the full archive has been validated.
# Goals:
# - make archive extraction path-safe
# - keep unpack behavior aligned with the expected archive layout
# - avoid silently dropping nested content
# Test plan:
# - valid flat archive extracts successfully
# - archive member with ".." is rejected
# - archive member with absolute path is rejected
# - nested directories either extract correctly or fail explicitly, depending on the chosen policy
# Short version:

# TODO: Replace extractall() with per-member validated extraction. Reject absolute
# and escaping paths, decide whether nested directories are supported, and avoid the
# current behavior where only top-level extracted files are moved into the output dir.


def unpack(

    """Unpack the static data.

    Unzip the input file and save the unpacked data to the output path.

    If use_build_number is True, the unpacked data will be saved to
    `<output_path>/<build_number>/`. Otherwise, it will be saved to `<output_path>/`.

    Checks for the presence of the _sde.jsonl file in the unpacked files. If the file is not
    found, raises a FileNotFoundError.


    Args:
        input_path: The path to the static data jsonl zip file.
        output_path: The path to the directory where the unpacked data should be saved.
        use_build_number: Whether to use the build number from the _sde.jsonl file to create the output directory.


    Returns:
        A tuple containing the path to the directory where the unpacked data is saved and the SdeInfo object.
