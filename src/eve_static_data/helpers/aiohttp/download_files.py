# Refactor plan: stream downloads to disk instead of buffering the full response.

# Goals:

# Avoid loading the entire response body into memory for large SDE archives.
# Make the final write atomic by replacing the destination only after a full successful download.
# Keep current overwrite semantics and error reporting behavior.
# Planned steps:

# Keep the existing path validation at the start of download_bytes_to_file.

# Reject directory targets.
# Reject existing files when overwrite is False.
# Ensure the parent directory exists.
# Replace the full-body read path.

# Remove the await response.read() call.
# Iterate over response.content in fixed-size chunks.
# Write each chunk directly to a temporary file.
# Create the temporary file in the destination directory.

# Use a temp file under file_path.parent, not the system temp directory.
# This keeps the final replace on the same filesystem.
# Finalize writes safely.

# Flush and close the temp file after the stream completes.
# Promote the temp file to the final path with an atomic replace operation.
# Only replace the destination after the full download succeeds.
# Add robust cleanup.

# If the request or file write fails, close and delete the temp file.
# Log cleanup failures separately without hiding the original exception.
# Preserve function behavior.

# Still call response.raise_for_status() before writing output.
# Still return response headers.
# Keep logging around start/end timing, but avoid per-chunk logging.
# Optional follow-up improvements.

# Choose and document a chunk size suitable for large archives.
# Consider fsync if stronger durability guarantees are needed.
# Add tests for overwrite=False, partial-failure cleanup, and successful replacement.
# Short version:

# TODO: Refactor download_bytes_to_file to stream response chunks to a temp file in file_path.parent, then atomically replace the destination on success. Remove the full in-memory response read, preserve overwrite checks, and guarantee temp-file cleanup on failure.

# Test plan:

# Successful large-file download writes in chunks and returns headers.
# Existing target with overwrite=False fails before network write.
# Failed download leaves no partial destination file behind.
# Temp file is created in the destination directory and cleaned up on error.
